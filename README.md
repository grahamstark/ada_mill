ada_mill
========

Mill is a simple persistence mechanism for Ada. 
It's based on the PHP Propel system (http://propel.phpdb.org/), 
which in turn is a port of the Java Torque project (http://db.apache.org/torque/). 
It's a code generator which takes an xml defintion file and writes a 
database definition and associated Ada code.
